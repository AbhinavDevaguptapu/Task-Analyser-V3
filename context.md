### **Commitment**

- Completion without any excuses.
- Completion means meeting the objective of the task, within the timeframe, with Commitment.
- When you have commitment, your self-esteem improves and people's trust in you increases.
- Few reasons why people can't stay committed:

  - Being in comfort zones.
  - Having resistances.
  - Being disorganised.

### **Objective (Outcome vs Output)**

- The objective is about getting complete clarity about the task that we are doing.
- **Set a complete and clear outcome for a task. Clarify any doubts about the outcome with the RP. Repeat the outcome with RP.** (User-provided content)
- Two important elements to consider in objective:

  - Taking clear instructions.
  - Understanding the outcomes of the task.

- Questions that help us get good clarity about the task:

  - What is the impact or value that we are going to generate?
  - What is our vision of the final outcome?
  - Who are we creating the value for?

- Without a clear and complete objective:

  - Our efforts are wasted.
  - Output doesn't serve the purpose.
  - There is excess use of resources.

- Steps in the objective before you start the task:

  - Set a complete and clear objective.
  - Confirm the objective with the person who assigned the task.
  - Visualise the outcome of the task.

### **Time Frame**

- A timeframe is the time by when we should reach the objective.
- A time frame should be:

  - Specific.
  - Challenging and Practical.

- With a time frame, there will be:

  - Increased efficiency.
  - Increased focus.
  - Increased problem solving ability.

- Mistakes we do when setting time frames:

  - Setting ambitious time frames.
  - Setting relaxed time frames.
  - Not revising the time frames.
  - Compromising on the quality to meet the time frame.

### **Quality**

- Quality affects the degree to which we meet the objective.
- How to ensure Quality:

  - Defining Quality Standards.
  - Creating Checklists.

- To Define Quality Standards:

  - Research on the standard of the work.
  - Depending on the resources, fix the standards for the task.
  - Keep them measurable.

- To Create Checklists:

  - A checklist is a list of specific actions to be performed in a given task.
  - It is important because we can't always rely on our memory.
  - Mark each item in the checklist as done once it's complete.

- An output with a substandard quality:

  - Does not fully satisfy the objective.
  - Requires rework, extra time and other resources.
  - Damages your reputation or the company's.

### **ELP (Execution Level Planning)**

- ELP stands for Execution Level Planning.
- It is a detailed plan of how we will execute the task.
- ELP gives us a step by step procedure to reach our objective within the timeframe.
- Four different stages in ELP:

  - Pre-ELP.
  - Creating Subtasks.
  - Task Flowchart.
  - Subtask Planning.

- Without a proper ELP:

  - The time frame is not met.
  - The quality is substandard.
  - There is chaos, confusion, and missing of essential aspects.

### **Efficiency**

- Efficiency is reaching the objective using the least amount of resources possible.
- Resources include time, money, people, etc.
- With efficiency:

  - We save vital resources.
  - We get more done with less resources.

- Ask yourself while planning: Can the plan be made more efficient?

### **Creativity**

- Creativity is creating something new that adds value to the existing process.
- Everyone can be creative.
- Ask yourself while planning: Can I be a bit more creative to reach the objective well?

### **Task Review**

- A task review is a process that ensures we stick to our ELP and reach our objective within the timeframe.
- Review is done at regular intervals during the task & before closing the task.
- In a review, we check whether or not we are sticking to the following things for each subtask:

  - Defined objectives.
  - Defined time frames.
  - Defined quality standards.
  - Defined checklists.

- Time intervals at which you're going to review should be decided while preparing the ELP.
- The frequency of review should be more for a new task and in the beginning of any task.

### **Growth Mindset**

- **Embrace Challenges:** View challenges as opportunities to grow, not as threats.
- **Persist Through Setbacks:** See failure not as a definition of your ability, but as a learning opportunity and a problem to be solved.
- **See Effort as the Path to Mastery:** Understand that sustained effort is the key to developing skills and achieving goals.
- **Learn from Criticism:** Treat constructive feedback as a valuable source of information for improvement, not as a personal attack.
- **Find Inspiration in Others' Success:** Use the success of others as a source of motivation and learning, rather than feeling threatened.

### **Learning Hour**

- The practice of analyzing the way we execute things.
- It helps us increase our performance day by day.

**How to do a Learning Hour:**

- At the end of the day or twice a day, analyse the tasks that you have done on that day and list down the following points.
- **Round 1:** Improvements.
- **Round 2:** Best Practices.
- **Round 3:** Appreciation / Praise.

---

**Our focus during R1 – Improvements:**

- **Problem** – The mistake that happened.
- **Core Point Missed** – The core/underlying reason why the mistake happened.
- **Action Items** – Specific steps that you are going to take to not repeat the same mistake.

**Our focus during R2 – Best Practices:**

- The points that worked out well in your execution.

**Our focus during R3 – Appreciation / Praise:**

- **Self-Praise** – Acknowledge something you did well today.
- **Peer-Praise** – Recognize someone who helped you or made your day easier.
- **Gratitude** – Express thanks for support, resources, or insights received.

---

**Implementation of action items from Learning Hour:**

- **Every day:**
  - Refer to the action items in the morning and include one-time action item in the day plan.
  - Take a moment to note one thing you achieved or someone’s help you appreciated.
- **Every week:**
  - Identify patterns and check if you are implementing your action items and moments of appreciation.

---

**Key Points:**

- Analyse your actions but don’t judge yourself.
- Act on Action Items.
- Use only Task framework language.
- Don’t worry about the mistakes; feel happy about the progress you’re going to make.
- Celebrate successes—big or small—and acknowledge the support you received.
